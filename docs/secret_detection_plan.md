# Secret Detection Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implemented secret detection and PyTorch-specific attribute scanning capabilities in LLMShield. These features detect hardcoded credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information in ML models and source code files.

## Implementation Summary

All planned features have been successfully implemented:

✅ **SecretScanner** - Comprehensive credential/API key detection
✅ **PyTorchAttributeScanner** - PyTorch-specific attribute scanning  
✅ **YAML-based detection rules** - 600+ patterns for secrets
✅ **Text file support** - Scan source code and config files
✅ **Integration complete** - Full scanner manager integration

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components

1. **YAML-Based Detection Rules** (`config/detection_rules.yaml`)
   - Comprehensive detection patterns for secrets, malicious code, and LLM vulnerabilities
   - Easy to update without changing code
   - Supports multiple categories: secrets, malicious_code, llm_security, suspicious_strings
   - Includes entropy-based detection rules
   - PyTorch-specific rules for suspicious keys and attributes

2. **YamlRuleScanner** (`scanners/yaml_rule_scanner.py`)
   - Base scanner that loads rules from YAML configuration
   - Supports pattern matching, entropy analysis, and category-specific checks
   - Extensible design for adding new rule types
   - Handles multiple detection categories in one scan

3. **SecretScanner** (`scanners/secret_scanner.py`)
   - Specialized wrapper around YamlRuleScanner for secret detection
   - Focuses on credentials, API keys, tokens, and passwords
   - Filters results to only show secret-related vulnerabilities

4. **PyTorchAttributeScanner** (`scanners/pytorch_attribute_scanner.py`)
   - Specialized scanner for PyTorch model files
   - Checks state dict keys for suspicious patterns
   - Detects dangerous attributes that could contain code
   - Scans tensor content for embedded secrets
   - Examines metadata and custom objects

5. **Integration with Scanner Manager**
   - Both scanners added to default scanner list
   - Automatically initialized when scanner manager starts
   - Compatible with CLI --scanners flag

## Implementation Details

### 1. SecretScanner
- **Purpose**: Detect hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords, tokens, and certificates
- **Approach**:
  - Regex-based pattern matching for common secret formats
  - Entropy analysis to detect high-entropy strings (likely secrets)
  - Support for various secret types:
    - AWS credentials (access keys, secret keys)
    - GitHub/GitLab tokens
    - API keys (Google, Azure, etc.)
    - Private keys (RSA, SSH, PEM)
    - Database connection strings
    - JWT tokens
    - OAuth tokens
    - Passwords in common formats

### 2. PyTorchAttributeScanner
- **Purpose**: Scan PyTorch model attributes for security issues
- **Approach**:
  - Inspect model state_dict for suspicious keys
  - Check custom attributes added to models
  - Detect embedded code in model metadata
  - Look for serialized functions or lambdas
  - Check for unusual tensor shapes or data

### 3. Integration Approach
- Keep scanners modular and focused
- Use existing BaseScanner interface
- Integrate with scanner manager's default scanners
- Ensure compatibility with CLI --scanners flag

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive detection of hardcoded secrets in ML models
- PyTorch-specific security scanning capabilities
- Better protection against credential leakage
- Enhanced security posture for ML applications
