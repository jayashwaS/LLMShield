# LLMShield - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical security blind spots. Organizations routinely download and deploy ML models from public repositories without the ability to inspect them for threats. These binary model files can contain hidden malicious code, backdoors, and exposed credentials that execute with full application privileges. Recent attacks have demonstrated how adversaries embed code execution payloads in model weights and create "sleeper" models that activate malicious behavior on specific triggers.

## Proposed Solution: LLMShield

LLMShield is an automated security scanner that addresses these critical risks by providing comprehensive threat detection for ML models and their associated files. The tool acts as a security gateway, analyzing models before they enter production environments, similar to how antivirus software protects against malicious executables.

### Key Capabilities:
- **60+ File Formats**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, source code, and configs
- **Comprehensive Detection**: Malicious code, backdoors, secrets, and vulnerabilities
- **Modular Rules**: YAML-based detection rules - easy to update without code changes
- **Low False Positives**: Smart filtering and context-aware scanning
- **Multiple Reports**: JSON, HTML, and text formats with remediation guidance

### How It Works:
```bash
# Scan a model before deployment
llmshield scan model.pkl

# Scan models from repositories
llmshield pull huggingface://microsoft/DialoGPT-medium --scan

# Generate security reports
llmshield scan /models 
```

## Getting Started - First Scan

Follow these steps to run your first security scan with LLMShield:

### Step 1: Install LLMShield
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jay123-1/llmshield.git
cd llmshield
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Step 2: Pull the Test Model
Pull the EICAR test model from HuggingFace (this is a safe test model with known patterns):
```bash
llmshield pull huggingface://eicar-canary/42-eicar-street --scan
```

### Step 3: Review the Results
The scan will automatically run and show:
- **CRITICAL**: EICAR test string detected (expected in test model)
- **HIGH**: Dangerous pickle opcodes found
- **HIGH**: Potential secrets in YAML files

### Step 4: Generate Reports
Generate detailed reports in different formats:
```bash
# HTML report with interactive filtering
llmshield scan ~/.llmshield/models/huggingface/eicar-canary_42-eicar-street/ -f html -o eicar_report.html

# JSON report for automation
llmshield scan ~/.llmshield/models/huggingface/eicar-canary_42-eicar-street/ -f json -o eicar_report.json
```

### Step 5: View the HTML Report
Open `eicar_report.html` in your browser to see:
- Interactive vulnerability list with filtering
- Severity breakdown chart
- Detailed findings with remediation steps

## 1. Scenario & Overview

### The Current Landscape
Organizations are increasingly adopting pre-trained ML models from various sources:
- Public model repositories (HuggingFace, Ollama)
- Third-party vendors
- Open-source communities
- Internal model sharing

### The Security Gap
Unlike traditional software, ML models present unique security challenges:
- **Opaque Binary Formats**: Models are stored in binary formats that can hide malicious code
- **Deserialization Risks**: Loading models often involves deserialization, which can execute arbitrary code
- **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**: Models may contain backdoors, trojans, or data exfiltration mechanisms
- **Embedded Secrets**: Models and configs may inadvertently contain API keys, credentials, or sensitive data

### LLMShield's Role
LLMShield acts as a security gateway, scanning ML models and associated files before they enter production environments, similar to how antivirus software protects against malicious executables.

## 2. Purpose of the Tool

### Primary Purpose
**Provide automated security scanning for ML models to detect and prevent security threats before deployment.**

### Key Objectives
1. **Threat Detection**: Identify malicious code, backdoors, and vulnerabilities in ML models
2. **Secret Scanning**: Detect embedded credentials, API keys, and sensitive information
3. **Compliance**: Ensure ML models meet security standards before production use
4. **Visibility**: Provide clear reporting on model security status
5. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate into ML workflows and CI/CD pipelines

---

## 3. Problems We're Solving

### 3.1 Arbitrary Code Execution via Model Deserialization
**Problem**: Popular ML frameworks use pickle for serialization, which can execute arbitrary code during deserialization.

**Solution**: 
- Opcode analysis to detect dangerous pickle operations
- Pattern matching for known exploitation techniques
- Recommendations for safer formats (JSON, NPY)

### 3.2 Supply Chain Attacks on ML Models
**Problem**: Models downloaded from public repositories may contain backdoors or malicious modifications.

**Solution**:
- Signature-based detection for known malicious patterns
- Behavioral analysis for suspicious model attributes
- Integration with model repositories for automated scanning

### 3.3 Embedded Secrets and Data Leakage
**Problem**: Models and configuration files often contain hardcoded credentials, API keys, or training data.

**Solution**:
- Pattern matching for common secret formats (AWS, GitHub, API keys)
- Detection of passwords, tokens, and credentials
- Support for multiple secret types across all file formats

### 3.4 Hidden Malicious Code in Model Files
**Problem**: Attackers can embed malicious code within model weights or metadata.

**Solution**:
- Deep inspection of model structures
- Detection of suspicious imports and function calls
- Analysis of embedded code blocks

### 3.5 False Positive Management
**Problem**: Security tools often flag legitimate model components as threats.

**Solution**:
- Intelligent exclusion system for vocabulary files
- Context-aware scanning
- Configurable rule sets
